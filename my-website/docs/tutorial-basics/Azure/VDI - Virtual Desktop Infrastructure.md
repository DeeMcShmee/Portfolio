## AZURE Virtual Desktop

    - Here's a new problem / chalenge : Users accessing sercured documentation remotely. 
        - A couple of things to analyze, do they need to acces the documentation localy or remotely or both?
        - What can they do with the documentation? Can they copy it or nned to use it with other apps?
        - Remote desktop in to a local server / machine would have been the way but it might create security issues and network access problems.
